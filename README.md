- After filling the basic details, the user will be given the otp and submitting the otp will make transaction successful and redirect the user to the Cricbuzz Plus page


## Roles and Responsibilities

- On the first day of the project we have decided the role of every member in the team.
- We have divided the task wisely among the team members.
- We organise a meeting daily to know the progress and error if any.

## Challenges

- Main challenge of the whole project was to avoiding conflicts of the name of the variable, class, id name. We have solved it wisely.
- second challenge was to merge the different files in the same final folder.

## Conclusions

learning a technology is a different thing and showing what you have learnt is different thing. This project has given us the confidence to showcase whatever we have learnt so far. This project also help us to learn those concept that can't be taught during class. Lastly I would like to thank all the team member of the group who coordinate remotely and let the project go smoothly.
